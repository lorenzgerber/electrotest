#Example1
$ python /cygdrive/c/Users/Stephen/Dropbox/höst/Linux_som/m6/Project/Lib3.py 1398

To achieve a resistance of 1398.0 use the following resistors:

1200.0
180.0
18.0

With these resistors you deviate 0.0% from your original value.
You will use a total of 3 resistors.

#Example 2
$ python /cygdrive/c/Users/Stephen/Dropbox/höst/Linux_som/m6/Project/Lib3.py 144

To achieve a resistance of 144.0 use the following resistors:

120.0
22.0
1.8

With these resistors you deviate 0.1% from your original value.
You will use a total of 3 resistors.

#example 3
$ python /cygdrive/c/Users/Stephen/Dropbox/höst/Linux_som/m6/Project/Lib3.py 2

To achieve a resistance of 2.0 use the following resistors:

1.8
0
0

With these resistors you deviate 10.0% from your original value.
You will use a total of 1 resistors.
